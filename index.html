    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>My name is Gordon Smith, I am a VCD Major, Web Dev Minor, UX Cert student. I have a 19 month old daughter, Addison, who is my world and my boss (along with my wife), and am the program supervisor for a child care center in North Spokane. My goal from this course is to get a solid foundation for web design, and development. I have some web design background via high school classes using Dreamweaver (about a decade ago), and a couple Dreamweaver class that I took at SFCC, on top of that I enjoy playing around with CSS on various reddit pages, though have never taken any courses that included actual coding, so I am excited about that.</p>
